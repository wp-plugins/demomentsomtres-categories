= History & Raison d'Ãªtre =

One of our customers wanted a page showing some of the categories in its website (but not all) as a table of contents containing the category name with a link and its description.

On a very first version of its website, this table of contents was build manually but, as the time went by, when they started to build many new categories, this page started to be unefective and hard to maintain.

The solution was to build this plugin to build the table of content on the fly.
