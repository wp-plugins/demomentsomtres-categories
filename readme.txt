== Description ==

Displays all categories and its descriptions on a list based on shortcode DeMomentSomTres-Categories.

* Category description is shown.
* Excluded categories can be used centralized from the settings or shortcode and widget based.
* Widget added since v2.0 in order to share excluded categories.

= History & Raison d'Ãªtre =

One of our customers wanted a page showing some of the categories in its website (but not all) as a table of contents containing the category name with a link and its description.

On a very first version of its website, this table of contents was build manually but, as the time went by, when they started to build many new categories, this page started to be unefective and hard to maintain.

The solution was to build this plugin to build the table of content on the fly.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which is the correct short code syntax =

The right syntax is `[DeMomentSomTres-Categories exclude="1,9"]` where exclude is optional and can contain a list of categories id to exclude (comma separated).

= If I set exclusions in settings and in the shortcode, what would it happen? =

It will mix both exclusion lists and all elements in the resulting list will be excluded.

= If I set exclusions in settings and in the widget, what would it happen? =

The same answer applies.
